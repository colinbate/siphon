# Intro

Siphon is light-weight PHP web service framework designed to support a wide variety of web service requests. It can be configured to use a single general purpose endpoint or multiple endpoints to facilitate the underlying business logic. Featuring automatic generation of WSDL and/or WADL files based on the actual code that provides the service. It uses inline documentation to obtain all extraneous meta data.

This was the work done during my Masters dissertation project in 2006/2007. Looking at it now, there are a number of things that I would probably change. :) But I have 5+ years of professional development work added to where I was when I wrote this.
